# Introduction-to-Time-Series-Analysis-and-Estimation-in-Python
These are the codes that support the lectures on time-series analysis and estimation in Python.

1. The Python file "lecture1.py" is used for explaining how to generate and test white noise and autoregressive time series. The video and post explaining these codes can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMf9C1G_Z8s and here https://aleksandarhaber.com/1-introduction-to-time-series-analysis-in-python/
2. The Python file "lecture2.py" is used to explain how to use and manipulate Pandas Series and DataFrame structures.
